# Profile: `harness`

The AI4S-oriented DataFlow Harness for text-modal science data: FastAPI, MCP,
live operator routing, pipeline validation, and evidence-grounded workflow
skills. No frontend, no Node.js.

```bash
./install.sh --profile harness
```

## What this is for

You drive DataFlow from Claude Code, Codex or Cursor and want the agent to build
pipelines for papers, abstracts, scientific sections, or research corpora. The
agent queries your **actual** operator registry, preserves source/evidence fields,
validates a pipeline before committing it, and executes it — without a browser.

Scientific text is the default specialization, not a separate runtime: PDF/URL
ingestion routes through `knowledge_cleaning`, while extraction, claim-evidence,
grounded QA, synthesis, and fidelity checks route through `core_text`. General
text pipelines remain supported.

This is a real product layer, not "webui with the frontend deleted". It installs on a machine with no Node.js.

## What this is not for

- A visual DAG you can drag around → use [`webui`](webui.md)
- Avoiding a running server entirely → use [`skills`](skills.md)

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+ (3.10 recommended) in an activated venv or conda environment
- uv (the default Python package installer; use `--pip` as a fallback)
- No Node.js required, and none is installed

If your shell's `python3` is older (macOS commonly still provides 3.9), choose
the intended interpreter explicitly. The installer installs and runs everything
through that same interpreter:

```bash
DATAFLOW_PYTHON="$(command -v python3.10)" ./install.sh --profile harness
```

## Install

```bash
./install.sh --profile harness --check      # verify prerequisites only
./install.sh --profile harness --dry-run    # print the plan, change nothing
./install.sh --profile harness
# If uv is unavailable or disallowed:
./install.sh --profile harness --pip
```

Steps: install `open-dataflow` with uv → install `backend/requirements.txt` → initialize the DataFlow core data directory → render and install the harness + standalone skills. Pass `--pip` to use pip explicitly.

Afterwards the installer verifies its own boundaries: it fingerprints every path
listed in this profile's `must_not_touch` (`frontend/src`, `frontend/package.json`,
`node_modules`, `.mcp.json`, `~/.codex/config.toml`, `~/.cursor/mcp.json`) before
and after the install, comparing every file's content hash, and fails if anything
changed.

## Run

```bash
./scripts/start.sh              # foreground
./scripts/start.sh --daemon     # background; PID in .backend.pid
./scripts/start.sh --status
./scripts/start.sh --stop
```

Defaults come from `installers/config.sh`: host `0.0.0.0`, port `8000`, MCP at `/mcp`. Override with `DATAFLOW_HOST`, `DATAFLOW_PORT`.

Opening `http://localhost:8000/` in this profile logs a warning about a missing UI index and serves no canvas. That is expected — the API and MCP endpoint are what this profile provides.

### Runtime surface

| | |
|---|---|
| API | `http://localhost:8000/api/v1/...` |
| MCP | `http://localhost:8000/mcp` (SSE transport) |
| Docs | `http://localhost:8000/docs` |
| Runtime data | `backend/data/` (registries, `ops.json`, preferences) |
| Cache | `backend/cache_local/` (pipeline execution scratch) |

There is **no authentication**. This is a single-user, local-first tool: binding to `0.0.0.0` exposes the API to your whole network, so keep it on a trusted network or set `DATAFLOW_HOST=127.0.0.1`.

## Connect an agent

Separate, explicit step — installing wrote no agent config:

```bash
./install.sh configure-agent --agent claude               # writes .mcp.json in this repo
./install.sh configure-agent --agent codex  --scope user  # asks before writing ~/.codex/
./install.sh configure-agent --agent cursor              # writes .cursor/mcp.json
./install.sh configure-agent --agent cursor --dry-run    # show the file, write nothing
```

### Configuring Codex on Python 3.10

Editing `~/.codex/config.toml` requires parsing it first — the configurator will
not touch a file it cannot validate. Python 3.11+ has `tomllib` built in. On
3.10, install the declared dependency once:

```bash
pip install -r installers/requirements-configure.txt
```

Without it, `configure-agent --agent codex` refuses and prints the block to add
by hand. Claude and Cursor are unaffected — their configs are JSON.

## Minimal verification

With the backend running:

```bash
curl -sf http://localhost:8000/api/v1/operators/categories | head -c 200
```

End to end through an agent:

```bash
claude --print --mcp-config .mcp.json --output-format text \
  "call mcp__dataflow__list_operator_categories and report the result"
```

Expect categories such as `core_text`, `general_text`, `reasoning`.

## Upgrade

```bash
git pull
./install.sh --profile harness          # idempotent; skips satisfied steps
./scripts/start.sh --stop && ./scripts/start.sh --daemon
```

## Uninstall

```bash
./install.sh --uninstall     # removes installed skills
```

Python packages are left in place; remove them with pip yourself. Runtime data under `backend/data/` is never deleted automatically — it holds your pipelines.

## Common failures

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `Cannot import app.main` | Backend deps missing | Re-run the install; check you're in the right Python env |
| `DataFlow core is incomplete` | A previous initialization failed partway through | Move the incomplete `backend/data/dataflow_core/` aside, then re-run the install; the installer will not merge into an unknown partial directory |
| Agent reports "MCP server not reachable" | Backend not running, or wrong port | `./scripts/start.sh --status`; re-run `configure-agent` if you changed the port |
| Cursor rejects MCP responses | Old build wrapping JSON-RPC in the API envelope | Fixed on `main`; make sure you are current |
| Tool calls fail with "tool not found" | Whitelist and routes disagree | `python3 installers/checks/check_mcp_whitelist.py` |
| Codex shows no MCP tools | Config read only at startup | Restart the Codex session |
| `Failed to process parameter: llm_serving` | Serving not assigned to every LLM operator | Assign a serving to each LLM operator, not just the first |
